Start Game LOGIC:

The basic idea is to fill Team A 'FIRST' if however there is no room we move on to team B:

Team A
1:
2:
3:

Team B
1:
2:
3:

if the list consists of:
1) 1 person [A]
2) 3 people [B C D] 
3) 2 people [E F]

then 

Team A
1: A
2: E
3: F

Team B
1: B
2: C
3: D

since team A had only two avaible spots after Person A was inserted, Persons B C D had to be placed
on Team B and then the remaining slots were filled with E and F
